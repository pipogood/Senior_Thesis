# Thesis Topic

Asynchronous BCI Based on Motor Imagery to control a character in the virtual world.

# Objective of Project

Building Brain-Computer Interface system for patients who want to control robot actuators instead of body parts movement using brain signals.

# Scope of Project

1. **Using Motor Imagery (MI)** Paradigm to control the movement of the character in Unity with 3 directions movement (Left, Right, Forward). 
2. **Real-time classification**
3. **Focus on Asynchronous BCI** because this system can be available for switching between **IC(Intentional control)** and **NC(non-control)** state by the user at all times.
    
    Existing BCI systems are categorized in two major classes: system-paced (or synchronous) and self-paced (or asynchronous).
    In system-paced BCIs, the user can only control the BCI during specific time intervals that are predefined by the system and not by the user.
    
    A self-paced BCI, on the other hand, can be available for control by the user at all times. It is clear that the second class is better and more efficient in terms of practicality and applicability to real-life applications.
